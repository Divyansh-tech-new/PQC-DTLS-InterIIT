PQC Certificate Generation Summary
===================================

Generated Keys:
- CA Key: ca-key.der (Dilithium Level 2 / ML-DSA-44)
- Server Key: server-key.der (Dilithium Level 2 / ML-DSA-44)
- Client Key: client-key.der (Dilithium Level 2 / ML-DSA-44)

Public Keys:
- CA Public: ca-pub.der
- Server Public: server-pub.der
- Client Public: client-pub.der

Note: For bare-metal RISC-V, these will be embedded as C byte arrays.
The authentication uses raw public key mode (RFC 7250) rather than
full X.509 certificates to save memory.

Signature Algorithm: Dilithium2 (ML-DSA-44)
- Security Level: NIST Level 2
- Public Key Size: ~1312 bytes
- Signature Size: ~2420 bytes
- Private Key Size: ~2560 bytes
